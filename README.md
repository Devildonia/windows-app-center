Windows App Center is a fully functional desktop environment that runs entirely in the browser — but under the retro Win95 chrome sits a deliberately **production-grade architecture**: a process Kernel that spawns **isolated Worker/iframe processes**, mediated **syscalls** behind user-consented **permissions**, an async **IndexedDB/OPFS** file system, a 3D physics engine, and a 626-test suite. It doubles as a **sandbox for developing modular systems** (VFS, Kernel, IPC, Rapier3D, Resource lifecycle) that can be extracted and ported into other projects.

> [!NOTE]
> Audited for stability, security, and performance (July 2026) — all findings remediated with regression tests. Since v1.6.6 the system follows a 6-phase **Web OS** architecture; per-phase design notes live in [`docs/webos-roadmap/`](docs/webos-roadmap/). See the [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md) for the full version history.

## 🎯 Why this exists

The "desktop in the browser" space is crowded — so this project leans on **engineering quality** rather than feature count:

- 🧠 **Real OS primitives, not a mockup.** A process `Kernel` that spawns genuinely **isolated processes** (Web Worker / sandboxed iframe) over an authenticated per-process IPC channel — a `while(true)` in an app can't freeze the desktop, and a watchdog kills it. Apps reach the system only through **mediated syscalls** gated by **user-consented capabilities**, and are confined to their own home directory.
- 🦴 **A 3D physics pet.** An interactive ragdoll powered by **Rapier3D + Three.js** with grab physics, procedural animation, and an AI state machine — a differentiator you won't find in most desktop clones.
- 🔬 **Determinism by design.** Zero `Math.random()` in logic paths; seeded PRNG where reproducibility matters. Hot paths are zero-allocation with a fixed-timestep loop.
- ✅ **626 tests** (unit, characterization & Playwright E2E) with coverage gates in CI — rare in this niche.
- 🎨 **Intentional aesthetics.** Pixel-accurate Win95 chrome plus a "Modern" theme, driven by a token-based theme engine — no AI-default look.
- 🧩 **Built to be extended.** Auto-registering apps, a scaffolder (`npm run generate:app`), and a runtime plugin API.

## ✨ Features

### 🏢 Desktop Environment
- **Process Kernel** — a real process table (`launch`/`kill`, PID registry, singleton handling) that owns every app's lifecycle, and spawns **isolated processes**: `spawnWorker()` (Web Worker) and `spawnIframe()` (sandboxed iframe over an authenticated `MessagePort`), each tagged with its `kind`.
- **Process isolation + watchdog** — heavy work runs off the main thread, so an app can't freeze the desktop; a `ProcessWatchdog` pings processes and kills unresponsive ones. **Prime Lab** demos it: the UI stays live while a worker crunches primes.
- **App Runtime SDK** — a guest-side SDK (`js/sdk/appRuntime.ts`) so an isolated app speaks the IPC protocol declaratively: it announces readiness, auto-answers pings, routes requests, and calls `syscall(name, args)`.
- **Syscalls + permissions** — processes reach the system only through mediated syscalls (`fs.read`/`fs.list`/`fs.write`/`notify`/`sys.log`), gated by a `PermissionBroker` that asks the user on first use and remembers the decision, and confined to the app's own home dir (`C:\APPS\<id>`).
- **App packaging** — install `.wapp` packages: an `app.json` manifest (id, semver, entry, declared `permissions`) validated and versioned, files laid into the app home, SHA-256 integrity stamp, a local registry, clean updates and uninstall. Declared permissions are the ceiling the broker enforces.
- **Service Container (DI)** — decoupled systems (Kernel, VFS, Window Manager, Audio, Resource Manager) resolved through a typed registry.
- **Virtual File System** — hierarchical directories persisted **asynchronously to IndexedDB** (escaping the ~5–10 MB `localStorage` cap), with binary/large files stored out-of-tree in **OPFS**, debounced writes, quota handling and automatic migration from the legacy `localStorage` tree.
- **Native Window Manager** — drag, resize, minimize, maximize, z-index focus, **Aero-style edge snapping**, and deterministic teardown.
- **Session resume** — the desktop remembers which apps are open and their layout, and restores them on reload.
- **Resource Manager** — owner-scoped registry (WebGL, audio, listeners, timers) with LIFO disposal for leak-free cleanup.
- **Theme Engine** — switch between *Classic Win95* and *Modern* live; all UI is token-driven.
- **Plugin API** — validate and register/unregister third-party apps at runtime through the Kernel.
- **♿ Accessibility** — ARIA roles, Alt+Tab window switcher, focus management, and an `aria-live` screen-reader announcer.

### 🎮 Ragdoll Pets (2D & 3D)
- **3D Physics Ragdoll** — Rapier3D + Three.js, with elastic grab, procedural animation, and AI states (Wander / Idle / Perform).
- **2D Stickman Pet** — Matter.js physics pet that reacts to the mouse, windows, and desktop icons.
- **Workshop** — customize skins, scale, and behavior.

## ✅ Testing

**626 tests across 55 files** — unit, *characterization* (behavior-locking tests for the Kernel, Window Manager, and Audio Manager), regression tests that encode every audit finding, and Playwright end-to-end boot/interaction specs. Coverage thresholds are enforced as blocking CI gates.

```bash
npm test              # watch mode
npm run test:run      # single run (verbose)
npm run test:ui       # Vitest UI
npm run test:coverage # coverage report (v8)
npm run test:e2e      # Playwright E2E
npm run typecheck     # tsc --noEmit
npm run lint          # ESLint
```

**CI (GitHub Actions):** runs on every push/PR to `main`, in three blocking jobs — **Code Quality** (`lint` + `typecheck` + `test:coverage`), **E2E** (Playwright), and **Production Build**.

```

Isolated processes never touch the VFS directly: they issue **syscalls** over their own
authenticated IPC channel, the **Syscall Broker** checks the capability with the
**Permission Broker** (user consent, remembered), and only then does it reach the VFS —
confined to the app's home directory.

### Architecture highlights
- **Kernel** — a `Map<pid, process>` registry with immediate cleanup on `kill()` and automatic `terminate()` propagation to app instances. Singleton apps refocus their running instance instead of duplicating. Processes are tagged `app` (in-realm), `worker` or `iframe`.
- **Process isolation & IPC** — `spawnWorker()`/`spawnIframe()` run code off the Kernel's realm behind a versioned IPC protocol. The host handle (`WorkerProcess`) talks to an injectable transport, so a Worker, a `MessagePort` or a test loopback are interchangeable. iframe processes get a **dedicated, authenticated `MessagePort`** (the host hands the port only to its own iframe; the guest accepts it only from `window.parent`) instead of the global `window` bus.
- **Syscalls, permissions & packaging** — a `SyscallBroker` mediates `fs.*`/`notify`/`sys.log`; a `PermissionBroker` asks the user for consent per capability and persists the grant; a `PackageManager` installs versioned `.wapp` packages whose manifest declares the permission ceiling. Every app is confined to `C:\APPS\<id>`.
- **VFS** — an in-memory tree (synchronous reads) over async **IndexedDB** persistence, with binary blobs in **OPFS** so large files never bloat the serialized tree.
- **Event-driven core** — a zero-allocation event bus where each handler is isolated (one failing listener never breaks the others), plus a reactive, persisted store.
- **Service Container** — a typed DI registry with async resolution (`whenReady`) and HMR-safe `unregister`.
- **Resource Manager** — owner-scoped disposables with LIFO teardown; `Kernel.kill()` and each app's `terminate()` release their WebGL contexts, audio nodes, listeners, and timers deterministically.
- **Determinism** — logic paths avoid `Math.random()`; hot paths use preallocated buffers and a fixed-timestep accumulator with render interpolation.

## 🧩 Creating an App

Apps **auto-register** — any file in `js/apps/*.ts` that calls `Kernel.registerApp(...)` is picked up automatically (no manual wiring). Scaffold one with:

```bash
npm run generate:app
```

Or write it by hand (see `js/apps/MyTestApp.ts` for the full template):

```ts
import { Kernel } from '../core/Kernel.js';
import { WindowFactory } from '../ui/WindowFactory.js';
import type { IWindowsApp } from '../core/Types.js';

export class MyApp implements IWindowsApp {
  public windowId = '';
  constructor() {
    this.windowId = WindowFactory.create({ title: 'My App', icon: '🧪', width: 400, height: 300 });
    // …render into WindowFactory.getBody(this.windowId)…
  }
  terminate(): void {
    // release listeners/timers, then:
    WindowFactory.destroy(this.windowId);
  }
}

Kernel.registerApp('myapp', MyApp, { name: 'My App', icon: '🧪', singleton: false });
```

**Runtime plugins:** third-party `IAppPlugin` definitions are validated by `PluginManager.validatePlugin` (ID pattern, required metadata, constructor check, duplicate-ID guard) and registered via `Kernel.installPlugin` / removed with `Kernel.uninstallPlugin`.

---

## 📦 PWA & Offline

The app ships as an installable PWA. A Workbox service worker (generated from the real build via `vite-plugin-pwa`'s `injectManifest`) precaches the app shell, so it launches offline after the first visit and can be installed to the desktop/home screen.

---

## 🌍 Browser Support

Best experienced in a recent **Chromium-based browser** (Chrome, Edge, Brave). Requires **WebGL2** for the 3D ragdoll and shader wallpapers. Firefox and Safari run the desktop and 2D features; some heavy 3D/HDR effects and the JS-heap readout in Task Manager are Chromium-only.

---

## 🗺️ Roadmap

The 6-phase **Web OS** roadmap (async VFS → isolated processes → syscalls → permissions →
packaging → session) shipped in **v1.6.6**; design notes per phase live in
[`docs/webos-roadmap/`](docs/webos-roadmap/). What's next:

- **Real zip container** for `.wapp` packages (the manager already takes a parsed package, so a zip loader plugs in) plus **package signing** via SubtleCrypto, and a store/catalog UI.
- **Permissions UI** — review, grant and revoke app capabilities from Settings.
- **Virtual workspaces** — multiple desktops (no compositor needed; just group windows per workspace).
- **Opaque-origin guests** — serve third-party apps from a separate origin so untrusted code runs with a true opaque origin (today's strict CSP blocks inline/cross-origin guest scripts, so guests are served from `'self'`).
- More capabilities: `net.fetch`, `clipboard.*`, `window.open`.

See the [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md) `[Unreleased]` section for the latest.

---

## ⚠️ Known Limitations

- **Persistence** is client-side: the VFS tree lives in **IndexedDB** and binary files in **OPFS** (hundreds of MB, subject to the browser's storage quota), with a `localStorage` fallback where IndexedDB is unavailable. Durability on an abrupt close is best-effort — async writes are flushed on `visibilitychange`, which is more reliable than `beforeunload`.
- **Single-user / client-side only** — no accounts, no server sync.
- **Third-party code isolation** — apps run in a sandboxed iframe with a dedicated, authenticated channel, but the hardened CSP (`script-src 'self'`) blocks inline/cross-origin guest scripts, so guests are served from `'self'` with `allow-same-origin`: that's realm/document isolation, not opaque-origin isolation. Truly untrusted third-party code needs a separate origin (see Roadmap). By design, no untrusted code is `eval`'d.
- Fake "hardware" figures in the Task Manager *System* tab are **simulated** (deterministic), not real device telemetry.
